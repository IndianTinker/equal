        This project was developed as a response to a few experiences while living in Madrid, Spain. I worked in a
        multicultural team with people from over 8 countries. Even though we worked together, our scope of travel and
        employment were defined by our nationality. </p>
      <p> For example: If a trip was planned to regions outside my area, I may not be able to go, as it would require me
        to go to the embassy and get a Visa (like for 'Morocco'). <br>
        Or In my attempts to get a job around my interests, the form often gets disabled or I never hear back if I
        select the "Would need a VISA to work" radio button.
        <br>
        <br>
        Travelling may seem a fun ride, but there is always a fear of rejection to obtain permissions. A small personal
        history for reference. My first travel to the Europe came after rejection of my VISA. We were travelling to
        Vienna for a prestigious conference. We filled an application of about 100 pages following guidelines of the
        embassy. Invested 10 days from our schedule to travel to another city to apply for a VISA. Our visa was
        rejected.
        Thankfully, The rejection was later revoked after a bit of drama. If that would not be the case, we would lose
        finances worth 50,000
        INR/ 890 EUR, partly on a pay-later grant. Eventually, we did suffer a loss of about 400 EUR as our flights
        travelled via Turkey and their
        was a mismatch between the Schengen and Turkish Visa dates. We had to book flights again at the airport. It is
        tough for some people.

        <br> <br>Recently, while applying for a <a href="http://rohitg.in/2018/11/04/spanishVisa/"
          class="link dim green">student visa</a> to come to Spain, it was even difficult. Standing in the queue,
        draining with sweat and being bitten by Delhi mosquitoes. Then being watched down by your own people working for
        another country. Thinking about "Stanford Prison Experiment".Then getting the VISA. I would say, its a miracle.
      </p>
      <p> These things made me question the idea that many companies and countries profess about "Equal Opportunity".

        I was annoyed and disheartened at such "cannot-explain-due-to-legal-reasons" responses and decided to probe my
        scope as an
        individual.

        <div class="f4 lh-title b pt3 mb1">What</div>
        I used a <a href="https://github.com/ilyankou/passport-index-dataset" class="link dim green">dataset</a> to
        visualize this "wall" that someone could see when looking at the world from her country. This tool should make
        you become more aware of this wall.<br>
        <br>
        The bricks vanish as you choose your country. This metaphor symbolizes your openess to the world. The less the
        bricks the more you can travel. On the map the countries highlighted show the world as it exists for you. The
        countries remaining countries would require a visa application.

      नमस्ते/ Hello/ 你好/ ¡Hola! I am Rohit ! <br>
      I am an interaction designer who believes in the power of design to generate rational discussions about the
      present and probable. I try to approach design as a dialogue with problems through diverse mediums. Design
      research, physical computing, behaviors, speculation, and emotions interest me a lot. I like to build and create
      things for creative inquiry with a research focus.
